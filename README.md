## Assignment / Task overview

#### Implemented

- [X] Fork the REMP-Crm_skeleton repo 
- [X] Add a new Benefits module
- [X] Add a new Admin navbar item
- [X] Add a way to add and manipulate benefits
- [X] Make benefits obey time limit rules
- [X] Create a new Frontend item for logged in users
- [X] Make users able to choose their benefit
- [X] Show the chosen benefit code to the user
- [X] Add a widget to user-detail showing the chosen benefit

#### What I didn't manage to do

- [ ] Translate templates - I don't think this is yet possible in the skeleton
- [ ] Make it possible to have the benefit limit dynamically set by the admins 
- [ ] Add a way to translate benefit content
- [ ] Custom styling for templates relating to this module - I kinda suck at Bootstrap and didn't get to wrtie custom CSS
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Handle secure file uploads
- [ ] Implement API and User Data Provider
- [ ] Add a way to see deleted benefits
- [ ] Add a way to keep history of benefit - user relations without blocking user from choosing a new one
